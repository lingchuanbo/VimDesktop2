Introduction
============

This tool lets you to close all running applications with just one click. It 
doesn't use system resources because it only flashes a ‘close’ signal to all 
open windows on the desktop and then ceases. Just place a shortcut to the tool 
in the Start Menu, Quick Launch or elsewhere.

You can always add a hotkey to this shortcut. It is really very handy if you 
are running ~20 applications and want them all to quit instantly. It works just 
as if you were pressing the close button for each application.


Advanced Options
================

If you want to prevent certain applications from being to be closed by Close 
All, you can add a simple exclusion list to the CloseAll.exe command line.

  CloseAll.exe -x="app-to-exclude.exe"

You can separate multiple values with "|" (pipe), example:

  CloseAll.exe -x="explorer.exe|firefox.exe|msnmsgr.exe"

Remember, you'd better test it before using it!
